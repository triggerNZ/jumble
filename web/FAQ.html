<h3>What does a <tt>.</tt> output mean?</h3><p>

It means that the test cases detected the mutation.  This is good.<p>


<h3>What does a <tt>M</tt> output mean?</h3><p>

It means that the mutation (which follows the <tt>M</tt>) was not
detected by the test cases.  This generally indicates the tests are in
some way deficient.<p>


<h3>What does a <tt>T</tt> output mean?</h3><p>

The mutation caused the unit tests to take much longer than expected
(possibly having put the code into an infinite loop).  Jumble gives
the tester the benefit of the doubt in such situations, and counts
this mutation as having been detected.<p>


<h3>Can Jumble ever incorrectly report an arithmetic problem?</h3><p>

Yes.  Certain combinations of operations and constants give the same
result for different examples.  For example,<p>

<pre>
y = x * sign;
y = x / sign;
</pre><p>

give the same result for <tt>sign = 1</tt> or <tt>sign = -1</tt>.<p>


<h3>Can Jumble ever incorrectly report a conditional problem?</h3><p>

Yes.  Certain pieces of code can be modified without invalidating the
code.  One example of this is where a condition is used to select
different code for performance reasons rather than correctness.
Suppose <tt>f1(x)</tt> and <tt>f2(x)</tt> compute the same function but
exhibit different performance depending on x.  Valid code might then be:<p>

<pre>
int foo(int x) {
    return x &lt; 10 ? f1(x) : f2(x);
}
</pre><p>

mutating the condition <tt>x &lt; 10</tt> would not change the correctness
of the code only the speed.  Unless there is a very sensitive speed test
this modification is likely to pass unit tests.<p> 

A similar situation arises in certain probabilistic algorithms.  The
following code executes the internal block half the time, but negating the
condition does not change the semantics:<p>

<pre>
void foo() {
  if (new Random().nextBoolean()) {
    // do something ...
  }
}
</pre><p>

Note, however, the selection of a specific seed for the random number
generator would render this code testable.<p>


<h3>Why does Jumble only make one mutation at a time?</h3><p>

A single mutation is generally harder for a test class to detect than
multiple simultaneous mutations.  Also, if multiple mutations were
made there is a slight chance they would cancel each other out.<p> 


<h3>Is any code exempt from mutation?</h3><p>

Jumble tries not to make mutations within assertions. Specific methods can
also be excluded from testing, by default <tt>main</tt> and
<tt>integrity</tt> are excluded.<p>


<h3>Can I Jumble an interface?</h3><p>

Not really, since an interface contains no code to mutate.  Jumble will
report a score of 100% for interfaces.<p>


<h3>What's the situation with abstract classes?</h3><p>

For the class <tt>AbstractFoo</tt>, Jumble will look for a test named
<tt>DummyFooTest</tt>.  This is done because there could be an actual
abstract test class named <tt>AbstractFooTest</tt>.<p>

The recommended Jumble conventions are to put some unit tests for the
<tt>AbstractFoo</tt> methods into the abstract
<tt>AbstractFooTest</tt> class, then inherit that class into the unit
tests for each subclass of <tt>AbstractFoo</tt> (say <tt>FooA</tt> and
<tt>FooB</tt>).  This means that JUnit will test the
<tt>AbstractFoo</tt> methods for each subclass of
<tt>AbstractFoo</tt>.  However, the methods in <tt>AbstractFoo</tt>
will not be mutated when Jumble analyses the subclasses of
<tt>AbstractFoo</tt>, because it is a design principle of Jumble to
analyse each class just once.  So we create a <tt>DummyFooTest</tt>
class that inherits <tt>AbstractFooTest</tt>, provides a "dummy"
implementation of any missing methods, and concentrates on testing the
methods of <tt>AbstractFoo</tt>.<p>

Of course, you can override these default Jumble naming conventions by
explicitly specifying your test classes on the command line, like this:
<pre>
    java -jar jumble.jar AbstractFoo FooTest1 FooTest2
</pre>
<p>



<h3>I cannot test something Jumble complains about?</h3><p>

Just because something is difficult to test does not mean it is impossible
to test.  Testing is generally a finite resource so it is appropriate to
concentrate testing where it is most important.  At best Jumble is just
another indicator of where potential weaknesses in the testing regime
exist.  Difficulty in writing tests can be genuine, or due to laziness
(e.g. not wanting to parse standard output), or symptomatic of a poor
design.<p>

There are a few situations where the limitations of Java and/or JUnit make
testing hard.  These include testing GUI code, audio code (indeed any code
where the JVM leaves uninterruptible threads hanging around), code which is
conditional on operating system and/or native code, and out of memory
conditions.  Testing algorithmic complexity can also be difficult in a
reasonable time; for example, making sure your algorithm really is
quadratic rather than cubic.<p>

Remember the purpose of Jumble is to identify potential problems, if after
examining a failure you convince yourself there is never going to be a
problem (e.g. because you have a formal proof) then the failure could be
ignored.<p>
